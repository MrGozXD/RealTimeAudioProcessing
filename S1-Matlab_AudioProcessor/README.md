## Objectives

This folder contains a self-sufficient Matlab script `audio_processor.m`. The present version of the code does nothing but copying audio data from an input audio file into an output audio file.  
Your goal is to implement modify this script to replace the data copy with the audio processing algorithm you chose. All you have to do is to __replace [line 41](audio_processor.m#L41) with your code__.

## Matlab environment
